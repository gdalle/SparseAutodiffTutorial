  abstract = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "autodiff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.}

This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.},

We approach this problem from a graph theoretic point of view and show that both direct and indirect approaches to this problem have a natural graph coloring interpretation.

The coloring variant used in the second step depends on whether the recovery in the fourth step is direct or indirect: a direct method uses star coloring and an indirect method uses acyclic coloring. In an earlier work, we had designed and implemented effective heuristic algorithms for these two NP-hard coloring problems. Recently, we integrated part of the developed software with the AD tool ADOL-C, which has recently acquired a sparsity detection capability. In this paper, we provide a detailed description and analysis of the recovery algorithms and experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the coloring techniques in the overall process of computing the Hessian of a given function using ADOL-C as an example of an AD tool. We also present new analytical results on star and acyclic coloring of chordal graphs. The experimental results show that sparsity exploitation via coloring yields enormous savings in runtime and makes the computation of Hessians of very large size feasible. The results also show that evaluating a Hessian via an indirect method is often faster than a direct evaluation. This speedup is achieved without compromising numerical accuracy.}

Several coloring problems occur in this context, depending on whether the matrix is a Jacobian or a Hessian, and on the specifics of the computational techniques employed. We consider eight variant vertex coloring problems here. This article begins with a gentle introduction to the problem of computing a sparse Jacobian, followed by an overview of the historical development of the research area. Then we present a unifying framework for the graph models of the variant matrix estimation problems. The framework is based upon the viewpoint that a partition of a matrix into structurally orthogonal groups of columns corresponds to distance-2 coloring an appropriate graph representation. The unified framework helps integrate earlier work and leads to fresh insights; enables the design of more efficient algorithms for many problems; leads to new algorithms for others; and eases the task of building graph models for new problems. We report computational results on two of the coloring problems to support our claims. Most of the methods for these problems treat a column or a row of a matrix as an atomic entity, and partition the columns or rows (or both). A brief review of methods that do not fit these criteria is provided. We also discuss results in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science that intersect with the topics considered here.}

Fortunately, these matrices often exhibit sparsity, which can be leveraged to significantly speed up the process of Automatic Differentiation (AD). This paper presents advances in Automatic Sparse Differentiation (ASD), starting with a new perspective on sparsity detection. Our refreshed exposition is based on operator overloading, able to detect both local and global sparsity patterns, and naturally avoids dead ends in the control flow graph. We also describe a novel ASD pipeline in Julia, consisting of independent software packages for sparsity detection, matrix coloring, and differentiation, which together enable ASD based on arbitrary AD backends. Our pipeline is fully automatic and requires no modification of existing code, making it compatible with existing ML codebases. We demonstrate that this pipeline unlocks Jacobian and Hessian matrices at scales where they were considered too expensive to compute. On real-world problems from scientific ML and optimization, we show significant speed-ups of up to three orders of magnitude. Notably, our ASD pipeline often outperforms standard AD for one-off computations, once thought impractical due to slower sparsity detection methods.},

Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of AD, however, requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region-based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open and practical problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and finding optimal methods to perform higher-order differentiation.

We will generally seek to rewrite such gradients in a form that allows for Monte Carlo estimation, allowing them to be easily and efficiently used and analysed. We explore three strategies---the pathwise, score function, and measure-valued gradient estimators---exploring their historical development, derivation, and underlying assumptions. We describe their use in other fields, show how they are related and can be combined, and expand on their possible generalisations. Wherever Monte Carlo gradient estimators have been derived and deployed in the past, important advances have followed. A deeper and more widely-held understanding of this problem will lead to further advances, and it is these advances that we wish to support.}
